# Lab 4 — Inheritance and equality

In this lab you will explore some aspects of inheritance in Java.
In the first part, you will refactor a provided solution which implements a simple calculator to gain experience with inheritance.
In the second part, you will explore the notion of "equality" in Java.

## Objectives

* To explore the the use of inheritence
* To practice recognizing when classes share data or similar methods and how to use inheritence to make these relationships explicit

## Given Files

Retrieve the files provided for this lab from GitHub classroom: **TODO** 

## Refactoring using Inheritance

In the `calculator` directory is a solution for a simple calculator (with support for variables).
For this part of the lab you will modify this solution to refactor common functionality out of some of the classes into a common class.

Many of the expressions are what we would typically call _binary expressions_. In particular, `AddExpression`, `DivideExpression`, `MultiplyExpression`, and `SubtractExpression` each have very similar behavior.
To see this clearly, compare `AddExpression.java` and `SubtractExpression.java`.

To refactor this common behavior, follow the steps below.

* Create a new class named `BinaryExpression`. This class should inherit from `Expression`.
* Each of the classes listed above must be modified to inherit from `BinaryExpression`.
* Now lift the common data out of these subclasses into the common parent class `BinaryExpression`. Make this data `private`.
* With the common data in the parent, the common functionality will also be lifted. Move the `evaluate` and `toString` methods into the `BinaryExpression` class.
* Add an additional argument to the `BinaryExpression` constructor. Modify the subclasses to pass a `String`, representing the operator, to the parent class. Update `BinaryExpression`'s `toString` to use this `operator` string.
* Modify the code in evaluate in the `BinaryExpression` class to evaluate each operand (i.e., `lft` and `rht`) and to pass the results to a new, `protected` method named `applyOperator`. This new method will not be defined in `BinaryExpression`, but must be declared (what sort of method is this?). In each subclass, implement this new method as is appropriate for the subclass’s operator.

## Equality

Examine the provided files in the `equality` directory.

For this part, you must implement `equals` and `hashCode` for the appropriate objects in order for all test cases to pass.

For the `CourseSection` class, you must implement `equals` and `hashCode` in long form (i.e., you must program all computations explicitly). Be sure to handle null values.

For the `Student` class, you must implement `equals` and `hashCode` using the appropriate methods of `java.util.Objects`.

## Submission

After you finish the lab, compress the lab folder and submit it on CANVAS.
