# Job Applicants - Loops and Lists

<small>This lab is adapted from <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bgYN1DheCS3YKgQCDfe71gQk7r6Nl3Bt8GbsXAtwJ4/edit?usp=sharing'>this assignment</a> in Evan Peck's list of Ethical CS modules for CS 1.</small>

## Objectives

-   To be able to iterate through different Java collections with
    various control loops (part 1)
-   To be able to write your own class with specified methods (part 2).
-   To be able to use unit testing, including writing your own tests for
    your code (part 1 and 2)
-   To be able to write a very simple UML diagram of a class (part 3)

## Resources

-   Your peers
-   Your instructor
-   The [Java Standard Library
    ](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/index.html)

## Setup

**Important**: For this lab, we will be using JUnit to help us test the correctness of our code. You can either let IntelliJ add it to your project automatically, or you can do it manually yourself. To do it manually, you'll need to download the JUnit library (available in the Modules page) and add it to your project in IntelliJ IDEA. Instructions for how to do it either way can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/testing.html).

**Aside**: What's JUnit? JUnit lets us make assertions about what our code *should* do. You can think of them as statements of *expectations*&mdash;for example, if we wrote a program to do addition, then we can *expect* that `2 + 2 = 4` and that `-1 + 3 = 2`. As a project grows over time, these assertions ("tests") grow along with it, giving us a "safety net" of checks that can assure us that our program is doing what we expect.

This lab allows you to practice Java syntax related to collections and control (Part 1), basic class structure and methods (Part 2), and includes an introduction to UML (Part 3).

## Algorithms as Future-Makers 

Imagine you are working for _Moogle_, a well-known tech company that receives tens of thousands of job applications from graduating seniors every year.
Since the company receives too many job applications for the Human Resources Department (HR) to individually assess in a reasonable amount of time, you are asked to create a program that algorithmically analyzes applications and selects the ones most worth passing onto HR.
Your job is to build an algorithm that helps determine the order which job applicants will be called in for an interview.
[This is a real scenario playing out every day and will likely impact you as an applicant someday.](https://hiring.monster.com/employer-resources/recruiting-strategies/workforce-planning/hiring-algorithms/)

To make it easier for their algorithms to process, *Moogle* designs their application forms to get some numerical data about their applicants’ education.
Applicants must enter the grades they receive from their 5 core CS courses, as well as their overall non-CS GPA at the university.
For your convenience, this will be stored in a Java array or list that you can access.
For example, a student who received the following scores...

<div id='courses'>

* **Intro to CS**: 100
* **Data Structures**: 95
* **Algorithms**: 89
* **Computer Organization**: 91
* **Operating Systems**: 75
* **Non-CS GPA**: 83

</div>

...would result in the following list:

```java
[100, 95, 89, 91, 75, 83]
```

That is, you can assume that index 0 is *always* **Intro to CS**, 1 is *always* **Data Structures**, and so on.

## Part 1: Java Control Constructs and Introduction to Collections

In the provided `part1` subdirectory, edit each of the given files to complete the implementations and tests.
Comments in each file will direct the edits that you are expected to make.
Look up any classes you don't know how to use (such as Map) in the Java Standard Library.

It is recommended that you use the order of the unit tests in `TestCases.java` as a guide for the order in which to complete the methods.
This order corresponds to the increasing complexity of the methods.
A good process to follow would be to read the first group of tests in `TestCases.java`.
Edit the corresponding class to make the code pass the tests. *Run* the tests to make sure they now pass.
Add the required additional test case. *Run* the tests again.
Then move on to the next group.

The output for a failed test is incredibly verbose (a stack trace is printed).
You can see the specific error at the numbered line above each stack trace.
*As you fix the code one file at a time, re-run the code to make sure that the number of errors is decreasing!*

## Part 2: Classes and Objects

For this part, you will implement a simple class (named `Applicant`) representing a job applicant and their resume.
Do this by creating a file named `Applicant.java` and put in all the code specified below.
This class must support the following operations (including a single constructor).

* `public Applicant(String name, List<CourseGrade> grades)` &mdash; Constructor.
* `public String getName()` &mdash; Returns the applicant's name.
* `public List<CourseGrade> getGrades()` &mdash; Returns the applicant's list of scores.
* `public CourseGrade getGradeFor(String course)` &mdash; Returns the score that was asked for. The `course` parameter can be one of the courses as defined [here](#courses). That is, `getGradeFor("Intro to CS")` will return the `CourseGrade` at index 0, `getGradeFor("DataStructures")` will return the `CourseGrade` at index 1, and so on.

Once this class is created, look at the `TestCases.java` file in the `part2` directory&mdash;complete the test cases or add new ones as appropriate.

You'll notice that the whole `TestCases.java` is commented out.
This is because the file would have had errors until you create the `Applicant` class.
Now that you've created the `Applicant` class, uncomment the entire file.

### Reflection

Read one or both of the following articles:

* [Algorithmic hiring: Complex hiring by the numbers?](https://hiring.monster.com/resources/recruiting-strategies/workforce-planning/hiring-algorithms/)
* [Can an Algorithm Hire Better Than a Human?](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/upshot/can-an-algorithm-hire-better-than-a-human.html)

Do you think the existing Applicant filters are fair? In particular, consider the `SimpleIf.applicantAcceptable` filter. Are there properties of an applicant you would like to consider, which we are currently ignoring? Are some of these properties harder to capture in a program than others?

**Creating your own filter**

You've now written and seen the effect of 3 different analyses. It's time to create your own.

You will decide what you think is the most fair way to filter applications. **You shouldn't just use what we've created so far. Come up with something better based on your responses above.**

So far, our `Applicant` only has a name and course grades. What other information do you want to take into account while deciding whether or not to accept the applicant? **Add the appropriate fields to the `Applicant` class.**

Then, in the `SimpleIf` class, create a new function:
* `public static boolean analyzeApplicant2(Applicant applicant)`

And implement your new filtering mechanism. In a JavaDoc comment for `analyzeApplicant2`, *explain in plain English* your rationale for this new applicant filter.

Finally, write tests in `part2/TestCases.java` to ensure that your new filter is working correctly.

## Submission

After you finish the lab, compress the lab folder and submit it on CANVAS.
