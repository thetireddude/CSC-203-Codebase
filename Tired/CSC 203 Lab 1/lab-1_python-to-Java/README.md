# Python to Java

This lab is designed to highlight some of the differences between Python and Java.
You need to translate a Python code to Java, so you get to practice with some 
already known concepts in both languages. Good Luck!

## Objectives

* To be able to translate a Python program to Java.
* To be able to develop and run a complete Java program.

## Resources

* Your peers
* Your instructor
* The [Java Standard Library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/index.html).

## Task overview

The project contains the following files:

* `lab00.py` — A file containing python code.
* `Lab00.java` — In this file you'll write a Java version of `lab00.py`, including its comments.

You can run your Java code by clicking the green "Run" button in IntelliJ IDEA. 

## Demo & Submission

After you finish the lab, compress the lab folder and submit it on CANVAS.
After you submit your folder, if you want you can demonstrate your working program
to the instructor or ISA to get your grade, otherwise you have to wait until the lab is graded.
