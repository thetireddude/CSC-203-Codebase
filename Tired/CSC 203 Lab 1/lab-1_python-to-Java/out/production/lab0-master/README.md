# Lab 1

This lab is designed to highlight many of the differences between Python and Java.
Many of the differences are purely syntactical.
Other features, like `for` loops, function differently.
If you are like me, you will need to get back in the habit of using your semicolons!

## Objectives

* To be able to translate a Python program to Java.
* To be able to develop and run a complete Java program.

## Resources

* Your peers
* Your instructor
* The [Java Standard Library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/index.html).

## Task overview 

Retrieve the files provided for this lab from CANVAS

The project contains the following files:

* `lab00.py` — A file containing python code.
* `Lab00.java` — In this file you'll write a Java version of `lab00.py`, including its comments.

You can run your Java code by clicking the green "Run" button in IntelliJ IDEA. 

You can disregard the following files, but don't delete them:
* README.md – This is the file you're currently reading.

After you finish the lab, compress the lab folder and submit it on CANVAS.
After you submit your folder, if you want you can demonstrate your working program
to the instructor or ISA to get your grade, otherwise you have to wait until the lab is graded.
